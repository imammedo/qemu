# Docker powerpc cross-compiler target for QEMU
#
# We can't use current Debian stable cross-compilers to build powerpc
# as it has been dropped as a release architecture. Using Debian Sid
# is just far too sketchy a build environment. This leaves us the
# final option of using linux-user. This image is based of the
# debootstrapped qemu:debian-powerpc-user but doesn't need any extra
# magic once it is setup.
#
# It can be used to build old versions of QEMU, current versions need
# newer dependencies than Jessie provides.
