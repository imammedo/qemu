# Debian Sid Base
#
# Currently we can build all our guests with cross-compilers in the
# latest Debian release (Buster). However new compilers will first
# arrive in Sid. However Sid is a rolling distro which may be broken
# at any particular time. To try and mitigate this we use Debian's
# snapshot archive which provides a "stable" view of what state Sid
# was in.
#

# This must be earlier than the snapshot date we are aiming for
FROM debian:sid-20190812-slim

 # Use a snapshot known to work (see http://snapshot.debian.org/#Usage)
